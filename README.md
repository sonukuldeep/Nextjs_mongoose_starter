# Nextjs mongoose template

This is a starter repo for all projects that need Nextjs and mongo database using mongoose.

[This](https://blog.usmans.me/how-to-use-mongoose-with-nextjs-for-mongodb) article was followed in part to make mongoose work with latest version on nextjs.

It is also possible to connect Nextjs and mongodb using versel by following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIlYroSsInU) video.

All credit goes to these articles and video for this repo to exist.
