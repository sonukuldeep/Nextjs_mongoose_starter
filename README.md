![main image](https://cdn.devdojo.com/posts/images/April2022/how-to-use-mongoose-with-nextjs-for-mongodb2.jpg?auto=format&q=70&w=600)

This is a starter repo for all projects that need Nextjs and mongo database using mongoose.

[This](https://blog.usmans.me/how-to-use-mongoose-with-nextjs-for-mongodb) article was followed in part to make mongoose work with latest version on nextjs.

It is also possible to connect Nextjs and mongodb using versel by following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIlYroSsInU) video.

All credit goes to these articles and video for this repo to exist. 

## Mongoose
Enter mongodb atlas uri into .env file so that the program can connect to your database

## Next-auth
Follow the official docs to setup oauth on google, facebook or whatever provider you want. Enter credentials in .env file.
Check old-way repo to see how i used next-auth earlier.
I have demonstarted 4 ways in which next-auth can be used
- 3 server methods
- 1 client method. check /client to see the emplementation
